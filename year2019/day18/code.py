# Do (letters +1) BFS's, finding the distances between each pair of keys
# (and between the keys and the starting point), recording for each
# destination key the doors and keys that you pass through on the way.
#
# Then do a breadth first memoized walk through the different ways to
# collect keys - for each key keeping track of the distance taken to get
# there. At the end we will have a shortest distance to all keys.
#
# It worked!
